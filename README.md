## RESERCH INTEREST
My mission is to develop a system that can effectively use social media content.
Currently, I am working on acquiring related tags by collecting social media data in real-time. I am also interested in the field of natural language processing. I am doing a cross-language information retrieval project at CSIRO Data61.
